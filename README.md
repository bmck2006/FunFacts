# FunFacts
-1st Android Project developed with instruction from Team Treehouse. 

This is a simple android application that populates "Did you know?" style random facts when a button is pressed. The layout of the main activity is also changed when the button is pressed. SharedPreferences data persistence is also used to keep current information displayed when the phone/tablet layout is changed from portrait to landscape (as this affects the Android Activity Lifecycle events). 

A video demonstration can be viewed here:
